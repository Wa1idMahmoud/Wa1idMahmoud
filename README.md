### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Walid, a highly skilled Senior DevOps Engineer and Software Engineer based in London, UK. Passionate about utilising cutting-edge technologies to automate and optimise software development processes. My expertise in DevOps ranges from infrastructure as code using tools such as Terraform and Ansible, to containerisation and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.

A recent project I worked on was with a financial services company, where I implemented a continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins, automating the build, test, and deployment processes for multiple applications, resulting in faster and more reliable releases. I also automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, allowing us to spin up and configure the whole infrastructure for different environments with a single command.

I also designed and implemented a containerised microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes, allowing for easy scaling and management of the application and improved reliability by isolating the different components and services of the application.

I have a wealth of experience in building and maintaining web-based applications, including a web-based CRM system built using ReactJS and NodeJS, and an e-commerce platform built using AngularJS, Python and Django. Furthermore, I helped in building a web-based application that connects job seekers with potential employers, using ReactJS, Material-UI, NodeJS and Express.js, and employed DevOps practices for efficient and reliable deployment, such as infrastructure as code using Terraform and containerization using Docker.
