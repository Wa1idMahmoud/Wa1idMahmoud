### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Walid, and I am a highly skilled Senior DevOps Engineer and Software Engineer based in London, UK. I am passionate about utilizing cutting-edge technologies to automate and optimize software development processes. My expertise in DevOps spans from infrastructure as code using tools such as Terraform and Ansible, to containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.

One example of a project where I put my DevOps skills into practice was with a financial services company, where I was responsible for implementing a continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins. This involved automating the build, test, and deployment processes for multiple applications, resulting in faster and more reliable releases. I also worked on automating the infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, this allowed us to spin up and configure the whole infrastructure for different environments with a single command.

In another project, I was responsible for designing and implementing a containerized microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes. This allowed for easy scaling and management of the application and improved reliability by isolating the different components and services of the application.

As a full-stack developer, I have a wealth of experience in building and maintaining web-based applications. One project that I am particularly proud of was the development of a web-based CRM system. The front-end was built using ReactJS and the back-end was developed using NodeJS and MongoDB.

In addition, I have experience working on an e-commerce platform built using AngularJS, Python, and Django. Furthermore, I helped in building a web-based application that connects job seekers with potential employers. The front-end of the application was built using ReactJS and Material-UI, while the back-end was developed using NodeJS and Express.js. I also employed DevOps practices to ensure efficient and reliable deployment such as infrastructure as code using Terraform and containerization using Docker.
